# react-project
A relatively simple React-Project that I've made for basic practice using React (And for a school assignment).

My goal with this project will be to make a simple quiz-app which picks a random question out of a pool and displays it on the screen. The player has to answer the questions and get the answer right.

This project was started on March 7th 2025, and the projected end-date is the 17th of March.

# IMPORTANT // HOW TO USE 
Files to edit are located inside src :)

The only known way to run this is through the Vite Development server. (I think? I could be wrong.)

To use the Vite Development server, install vite through Node.js and the run: **npm run dev**
