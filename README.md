# react-project
A relatively simple React-Project that I've made for basic practice using React (And for a school assignment).

My goal with this project will be to make a simple quiz-app which picks a random question out of a pool and displays it on the screen. The player has to answer the questions and get the answer right.

This project was started on March 7th 2025, and the projected end-date is the 17th of March.
